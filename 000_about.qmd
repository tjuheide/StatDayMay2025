### About

This site is a brief walk-through of how various types of risk curves can be made in R. The focus is on the graphical rather than analytical aspects. I.e., we start from a dataset that has been analysed and cleaned and is ready to be plotted.

`SAS` will be mentioned a few times but no knowledge of `SAS` is needed. However, it is assumed that the reader has some prior knowledge of `ggplot2`.

The data can be found [here](https://github.com/tjuheide/StatDayMay2025/blob/main/data/riskdata.csv), scripts used to create this website are [here](https://github.com/tjuheide/StatDayMay2025).
